# PROJECT DROWSINESS

## Introduction

This project focuses on building a driver drowsiness
detection system that monitors a driver's eye status using a webcam and alerts if they appear drowsy.
We utilize the **OpenCV** for image capture and preprocessing, while a **Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)** model clarifies whether the driver's eyes are 'Open' or 'Closed.' If drowsiness is detected, an alarm is trigerred to alert the driver.
